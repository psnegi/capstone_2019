* Course Description
  
*This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor*

Students identify and fill a demand for an innovative data science product, such as a data base tool, analytical software, or domain specific analysis (life science, social sciences).
The product is defined, implemented, documented, tested, and presented by the student or student team with the instructor and other stakeholders acting
as a project supervisors to verify that goals are met through the 10-week development process
Focus will also be on best software engineering practices and reproducible research.

** syllabus
- Students progress will be discussed every week  in the  class as per assigned/agreed work in the project.

- Answer/help students on their project

- Informal discussion about some topics



* Grading
  There will be a final project and project presentation.

One has to do  a *project*  to full fill course requirements.
There will be a final presentation of the work done during current quarter.
You will be required to  submit a final report.

*Please respect DU [[https://www.du.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/honorcode.html][Honor Yourself, Honor the Code]]*


* Projects ideas
  If you not doing to an internship or independent study then identified a project for yourself.
  Here are some ideas for capstone project. Dash board front end is also required for any capstone project.

 - Fake news detector. Initial data can be obtained from  [[https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news][Getting Real about Fake News]].
   Once the model is build, use python and flask and pass an URL of news site in a page and predict it is fake or not. Once has to do webscrapping etc to extract the content from webpage.

 - Human Trafficking project at DU

 - Predicting stock price based on current news and past trend
